00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,533
Hey everyone! Have you ever felt confused and overwhelmed

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:09,032
not being able to find those pesky deleted or modified files on the computer? Well, fear no more cause AEAS is here to help!

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,602
So, what's AEAS?

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:15,870
It's an application that helps e-forensic investigators get their work done!

5
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:23,634
Basically, the e-forensic investigators seize necessary evidence (i.e. the system), acquires the data (i.e. e-forensic image), 

6
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:27,911
analyses it and reports their findings of deleted and modified files with necessary details.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,780
And our program will do the final two steps for them, simplifying and speeding up the entire process!

8
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,685
Lets take a look at some existing software. 

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
So, what’s the problem with all of these?

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,964
There are three key issues are common in existing solutions.

11
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:50,694
They have a steep learning curve. You need to already understand the specific software to use it.

12
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:56,473
As shown on the previous slide, a lot of information is displayed all at once, and this can be overwhelming.

13
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:04,071
Some common processes require clicking through countless unnecessary wizards and dialogs, which is inefficient.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,933
<font size="10px">Our team has been collaborating with our client, Bad Security Incorporated.</font>

15
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:13,317
<font size="10px">This collaboration allows our team to explore and understand the problem and solution space of the project.</font>

16
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:21,586
We spent a lot of time defining the problem space – drilling down into industry weak points to gleam key areas for improvement.

17
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:26,354
From there, we designed the application by prioritizing the three design principles on the slide.

18
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,547
Make it simple, make it smooth, and make it sleek.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,917
Let’s see these design principles in action.

20
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:39,198
A simple, sleek user-friendly interface, and the whole process from project start to report generation takes only 8 seconds.

21
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:42,937
And here are some of the things that AEAS will put into the report.

22
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:50,814
The key statistics are hard disk information, a list of detected files, results from a string keyword search,  

23
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:54,049
and a timeline of file modifications performed on the machine.

24
00:01:54,858 --> 00:02:00,171
AEAS will leverage tried and tested tools, to ensure the integrity of data analysis.

25
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:08,497
AEAS will be able to identify suspicious files, whether they have been deleted, obfuscated or unallocated.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,057
Modern frameworks such as react and electron allow for a clean application that is user friendly and portable.

27
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,102
AEAS will produce reports on its findings for expert forensic specialist 

28
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:25,976
to quickly get informed for further investigatory decision making.

29
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:32,623
This will be provided as a software package built on and for open source technologies.

30
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,136
What does the future hold for the AEAS team?

31
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:42,267
We will use an agile inspired work process to allow us to adapt our development to the feedback we get as we:

32
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,715
Prototype, Polish, Test, and engage end users.

33
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:51,199
The AEAS team is confident that we will be able to deliver a high quality application that streamlines 

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,628
and kickstarts the forensic process, allowing investigators to focus more on what is important.
